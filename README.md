A question within the context of this lab assignment:

How was the security of the API key addressed, particularly when incorporating it into the Netlify deployment process?


An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment:

It's notable that the iterative development process, with frequent deployments to Netlify, provides an effective way to visualize and test the application's progress in real-time. This ensures that each feature is functioning as intended before merging into the main branch.
